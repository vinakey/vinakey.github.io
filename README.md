# gotiengviet

## Description

This project is a web-based Vietnamese Input Method editor that utilizes `avim.js` to provide Vietnamese typing capabilities on the web. It is especially useful for Linux users, as Chromium on Ozone (Wayland) does not work well with IBus. You can pin it to the sidebar and use the middle click to paste (if you use Linux).

## Features

- Automatic selection of input method based on typing.
- Multiple input methods: AUTO, TELEX, VNI, VIQR, VIQR\*.
- Emoji support.
- Option to use the old accent style.
- Responsive UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
